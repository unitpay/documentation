# Interface of Referrer's \(Agent's\) Account

From the end of 2019, our partners can participate in the referral program.

You can become a referrer, attract new customers and get 15% of the Unitpay commission from the referrals' payments.

To become a referrer \(agent\), please contact your account manager or the Unitpay customer support - Unit.Help.

When you become an agent, the [Referral Program](https://unitpay.money/partner/referral) link will appear in the footer of your personal account.

To get started, you need to **enter a tag** to identify the link \(1\) and **create a link** to register your Unitpay account \(2\). You can copy the link and **send** it to a potential **referral** by clicking on the Copy icon \(3\).

The resulting link leads to the Unitpay account registration form.

Agency fee will be charged only if the referral registers via the link!

One or more referrals may register using the same link. In this case, the revenue from them will be summed up in a single line.

The agency fees can be credited to the referrer's account balance by clicking the Add button. The credited funds can be withdrawn in any way available for your account type.![](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2Fdokumentacziya%2F-M9xezG_6tZ_3GRmvyig%2F-M9y1tmdiARYsXI4TOKk%2F1.png?alt=media)https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/O5QC4JIBUXot7j7A\_1RsxHatBuKbXq3YKugIL9HVmdVUI-QX6hZNjc2HG3EuMLH-qeEGYpiRVB7gOBcGOLFoGFuLHthMYHZStIjYIu6BuSuH5ypzMWnHikW60XSkdR5vpZIPyqd2
