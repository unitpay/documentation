# Wix

The payment solution for Wix is an integration through adding an Ecwid store and installing an application through the Wix App Market. More details can be found [here](https://support.ecwid.com/hc/en-us/articles/207808335-Ecwid-plans-and-pricing-for-Wix).

After adding the Ecwid store, you can install our [Ecwid module](https://help.unitpay.money/v/en/modules/cms-modules/ecwid) inside it.
